Python Questions :
I have a couple of problems that I would like you to work progressively on paper using python code without any import modules.  
1.	If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. 
    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. (Answer: 233168) (solution code attached: problem_1_solution_code.py)
    
2.	Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, 
    the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. (Answer: 4613732) (solution code attached: problem_2_solution_code.py)
    Once you have them written on paper, can you put that code on the system and make changes as required and share the changed code as well.
